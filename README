This is a prototype of allowing embedding Chromium/Blink into Qt.

-- Build instructions:

(1) Get the Chromium source code, see instructions at http://www.chromium.org/blink/conversion-cheatsheet
    Currently this is a bit iffy due to the WebKit -> Blink transition, but this is what worked for me:

    * git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
    * Add depot_tools to your PATH
    * export GYP_GENERATORS=ninja
    * fetch --nosvn=True blink
    * If that didn't do the trick, it should essentially boil down to running "gclient sync"

(2) The build of Chromium itself uses ninja and is out-of-source. Go to for example

     cd src/out/Release

     and build the content shell with

     ninja content_shell

     Similarly src/out/Debug can be used for debug builds.

(3) Re-generating the ninja build files after changing a gyp file:

    * Make sure GYP_GENERATORS remains set to ninja
    * Run src/build/gyp_chromium

(4) On Linux you may get build errors due to -Werror. Create ~/.gyp/include.gypi with the following contents:

    {
      'variables': {
        'werror%': '',
      },
    }

    So afterwards you have to re-create the ninja files using gyp_chromium

(5) After building content_shell (which depends on all we need), set CHROMIUM_SRC_DIR to /path/to/src
    and build this module with qmake && make
