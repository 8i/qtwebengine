Important Changes
-----------------

 - [QTBUG-60565] Fixed that Chromium was incorrectly exporting its own new
   and delete operators in Qt 5.8.0. However, applications that linked and
   used those versions of new or delete will not be able to load with 5.9,
   where they no longer exist. This primarily affects shared Linux builds,
   where exported Qt symbols were tagged with Qt_5.


Chromium Snapshot
-----------------

 - Updated the Chromium version to 56.0.2924.122.
 - Changed the Chromium build-system to GN.

General
-------

 - Took Q_ENUM to use on QtWebEngineWidgets interfaces.
 - [QTBUG-56677] Made printing to a PDF file emit the signal
   pdfPrintingFinished() in both QQuickWebEngineView and QWebEnginePage.
 - Added a setting to again allow insecure origins to request geolocation.


DownloadItem
------------

 - [QTBUG-58155] Fixed that (QWebEngine)DownloadItem::path() incorrectly
   returned percentage-encoded filenames when the suggested path was based
   on a URL. Percentage-decoding the path is generally not only incorrect
   when the path is not based on URL, but also dangerous as it can lead to
   downloads that escape the download folder.
 - [QTBUG-56839] Added a downloadInterruptReason property for interrupted
   downloads to download items.


Qt WebEngineWidgets
-------------------

 - [QTBUG-53314, QTBUG-53372] Added the QWebEngineHttpRequest class for
   sending HTTP requests over the network using HTTP POST or with custom
   HTTP headers.

 - [QTBUG-58673] QWebEnginePage: Started calling the javaScriptConfirm
   method also for unload dialogs (onbeforeunload handlers).
